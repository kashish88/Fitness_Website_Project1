     Yoga poses are great to strengthen and relax the body, however there's a lot more to Yoga than that.

Derived from the Sankrit word yuj which means to unite or integrate, yoga is a 5,000-year-old Indian body of knowledge. Yoga is all about harmonizing the body with the mind and breath through the means of various breathing exercises, yoga poses (asanas) and meditation.

Yoga can be effective for weight loss and back pain; it can help you touch your toes and bend over backwards; it might, even, help you compete with those trapeze artists at the circus!

But more importantly, it can help you attain a sense of composure and acceptance with yourself, with your life and with those around you. It takes you to a different level of consciousness and understanding, where you gain perspective and peace.
