	<h1>How TruFit Began</h1>
	<hr>
	<p><b>
		I used to absolutely love boutique fitness classes. With great instruction, heart-pumping music, fun choreography and high caloric burn--what was not to love? Classes suddenly made my workouts enjoyable. But attending a fitness class wasn't always easy. I frequently found myself over-scheduled and cash-strapped; unable to justify frequent attendance to my favorite studios. 

I like fitness because a great workout makes people feel confident. It makes me feel confident. So much of at-home fitness today is one-size-fits-all. But we are all unique, with different interests and motivational triggers. My dream is for TruFit to be the place where you can discover workouts that genuinely excite you and make you feel great about yourself.

I hope you all join me on this journey :)
